## About The Project:



## Project requirements:

The basic project requirements are defined by Microverse and can be seen in this <a href="https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-final-capstone/blob/main/projects/business_requirements.md#project-requirements">link</a>.

User stories:  In addition to the basic project requirements, a set of specific requirements was developed from a list of user stories, as shown below:

A) When I go to the home page:
1. I can see a selection of the latest properties to rent on the home page, with 1 photo, property title, country, city,  and rate.
2. If I click on a photo or property title, I can see:
- The property title,
- The whole address,
- The category or categories assigned by the owner (beach, family, honeymoon, mountain, etc.),
- A big photo and several photo miniatures that can show bigger in a popup if clicked,
- A description,
- The guest_capacity, the number of bedrooms, beds, baths,
- The kind of property (house, apartment, villa, etc.),
- The size (must indicate what measurement unit is the size, mts2 or ft2, etc),
- The rate per night, week, month,
- The minimum period of time that the property rents for,
- The cleaning fee,
- A button or link to go to the reservation page for this property,
- A button or link to go back to the home page

3. I can also see a select button to select a country to show properties for that country only.
4. After selecting a country, I can see a title indicating the chosen country, and the list of properties for that country with 1 photo, property title, country, city,  and the rate per night, week, etc.  Also, inside a parenthesis, must be the minimum time for rent.
5. After clicking on one photo or property title, I can see all the same information shown in A.2. But the button or link to go back must take me to the country list page.
6. When I click the reservation button, I can see the fields to enter check_in and check-out dates (or a calendar to select dates), and also a field to enter the number of guests that will stay in the property (the entered number of guests must be greater than 0, and smaller or equal to the guest capacity of the property).
7. I can see a ‚ÄúCheck dates‚Äù button to check if the requested reservation period is available.
8. After clicking on this button, I can see the messages: ‚ÄúThe property is available for your requested dates‚Äù or ‚ÄúSorry, the property is not available for your requested dates. Please try a different time period‚Äù.
9. If there isn‚Äôt availability, I can enter different dates to start a new check with the Check dates button.
10. I can also see a button to go back to the properties list (home page or country list page).
11. If there is availability, the page also shows the total amount to pay for the reservation.
12. The page shows a ‚ÄúReserve‚Äù button if there is availability.
13. If I click the ‚ÄúReserve‚Äù button, that takes the user to a page for signing up (with name, email, and password) or logging in (with email and password).
14. After successfully sing up or logging in, the page opens again the reservation page with the reservation information (user name, property title, check-in and check-out dates, total amount to pay). It shows also a confirmation message with the reservation ID and tells the user that an email will be sent to her/his email address with instructions for paying the reservation.
15. If the user was already logged in, the signup or log-in is skipped.

B) In the navbar I can see a button or link to ‚ÄúBecome a Host‚Äù. If I click this button I will see:
- The page for signing up (with name, email, and password) or logging in (with email and password).
- After successfully sing up or logging in, I can see a form to upload all information and photos for a new property (see A.2).
- If the user was already logged in, the ‚ÄúBecome a Host‚Äù button takes the user directly to the form, without requesting sign up or log in.
- After entering the new property info, the page shows the homepage and a message with: ‚ÄúThank you for uploading your property‚Äù.
- There must be an option for the property owner to block periods of time to avoid users to make reservations on those periods.

C) In the navbar I can see also buttons or links to sign up, log in, and log out.

D) In the navbar I can see a button to show the list of all uploaded properties for the logged-in user. After clicking this button, the page shows the list of property names uploaded by the logged-in user. Each name is a link to the show page of the property. If a name is clicked, the page will show:
- The name of the property,
- A button for updating general information,
- A button for deleting the property from the list,
- And a "Block periods" button for creating blocked periods.
- If the "Block periods" button is clicked, the page shows a form with two input fields (or a calendar) to enter start and end dates for the block period, and a button to save the new blocked period. After saving the blocked period, the page shows again the list of uploaded properties for this user, which contains a button to navigate to the homepage.

E) In the navbar I can see a button to show the list of all the reservations created by the logged-in user, with the name of the property, reservation Id, and a button to delete it.
